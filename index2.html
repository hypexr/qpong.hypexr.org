to have it online even if no one is playing it.  I lost the latest copy of
the site so the news bellow is really really old.  I will have the forum
working shotly but I doubt any QPONGers will stuble upon this site for a
long time if ever.  If anyone knows of an active qpong server drop me a message
at <a href="mailto:scott@hypexr.org">scott@hypexr.org</a>.

                       The tournament didn't work out as well as everyone
was                       hoping but I would still like to see a QPong league
form                       where qpongers can casually meet at scheduled
times and                       get a few games in.  If anyone is interested
in                       setting this up e-mail me at <a
 href="mailto:qpong@qp.org">qpong@qp.org</a>.                        Unfortunately
I am very short on time this semester and I                       can not
update the site as often as I would like.  If                       anyone
wants to help with making updates and/or adding new                     
 sections etc. drop me a line and I will set you up an                  
    account where you can access and update the page.                   
    Our forum host is also notifying me that they are going             
         out of business due to the economy so expect to see a new      
                message board added soon.  Happy splatting!</font>

for battle.                       :) Some time in here we will have a vote

                       </font>Had some very good QPONG action tonight.  I 
                      added a new message forum to the site which everyone 
                      should enjoy.  It will hopefully promote more posting 
                      than the old forum did. The old forum had some very
recent                       posts on it and can be found at:  <a
 href="http://www.InsideTheWeb.com/mbs.cgi/mb986883">http://www.InsideTheWeb.com/mbs.cgi/mb986883</a>.  
                      The new message board is at: <a

                       I've been trying to get the word out about this tournament 
                      and I know that there are tons of qpong fans out there
who                       would love to participate in splattering action
but they                       need to know about it.  Please, post messages
about                       the tournament and get your friends to join. 
If we                       do not get enough people, we will have to change
it to two                       players per team which I do not believe will
be as much                       fun. </font></td>

lack of                       update material.  I moved out of my house into
an                       apartment with a couple of friends a couple of weeks
ago                       so I haven't had much time (This is the first time
I have                       been connected to the internet. hehe)  Anyways
